## Sanghaplanner

This is my first Laravel project and is mainly intended for learning PHP and Laravel.

## What will it do once it is finished ...

People will be able to register as a user of the Sanghaplanner. Once registered they will be able to create a new sangha, or become a member of an existing sangha. *)

Sangha administrators can create events, and for each event they can create organisational tasks.
Sangha members can register for an event and pick up one or more tasks to carry out.

For each event there will be an overview of the members that will attend and the tasks that are assigned. 

*) A community of Buddhist practitioners is referred to as a “Sangha” (Sanskrit for inseparable)
